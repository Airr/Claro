          Claro GUI library
===========================================================

This is a revival of the Claro GUI library from Gian Perrone and Theo Julienne.

Claro is a set of cross-platform libraries which assist programmers in writing applications which can run on almost any platform without modification. 

This project aims to revive this abandoned project and to provide wrappers for
Nimrod.

To try it out, build it with::
  
  python koch.py claro


Enjoy!
